A join us page which has a form and contact information (the contact us will be the same as the join us so we would rename the contact us at the footer 

## Main page 
- A welcome to the syndicate section where the get started brings a person to the contact or join us page.
- Below is a list of associates and partners we will get the logos from (like ubani will).

- The next section explains the main focus areas of tech we want to expand on and explore in the country alongside our partners. 

- The section after that are reasons to become involved as either a member, an syndicate associate or a syndicate investor.

- After this would be a social media picture collage of the Facebook page making meaningful posts on the posts.

- Then a reference of the top 6 partners, their positions and names to give extra authority.

- Then a small form can can be used and the footer at the end with the socials, our blog which will have latest syndicate, technology and business news for any fans and followers we have watching our content and 3 extra doc pages.

## Doc pages
- The first doc page is a get started which explains how you can make a difference and impact without being formally part of a group by keeping up with the community and updates and sharing with friends, or have your own event and share that information with the syndicate so we can distribute amongst our network 

- The second doc page explains how the syndicate is structured and how we make decisions with links to all our transparent operations so you can keep track of our progress even as a non member 

- The third doc is a list of our needs, wants, goals, mission, vision and passions (a more specific version of what drives us and what do we focus on page)

- The product section can be transformed into our partners section, all depends 

- No plans on what to do with the sidebar so may remove it entirely and use the functionality elsewhere
